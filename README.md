# Mentzer Cassette Transcript

### Published on Mike Mentzer's 70th birthday: November 15th, 2021.

A text (PDF) translation of Mike's cassette series, titled Mike Mentzer's New Advanced High-Intensity Training Program, published around the year 2000. I used the Google speech-to-text API to generate it, then edited it myself. Google was about 90% accurate.
